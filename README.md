# try-logout-counter
A sample PHP software or website to tackle the problem of deactivating a user account if the user logs out more than the time or day specified.Â If the current day has crossed the days' duration, the user account will be deactivated; otherwise, if the user logs in before the days' duration has passed, the account will not be deactivated, and the logout day counter will reset.
